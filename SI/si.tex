		These are the notes of the Statistical Inference course for the Academic Year 2025-2026 with Professor Favaro.\par
		I took these notes personally and I integrated the (many) unclear parts and passages using online resources and occasionally the fucking shitty books that this course has. \par
		I am not particularly enthusiast about this course but, as a person with no mathematical background from bachelor degree, I firmly believe in the necessity to understand what you are fucking doing and therefore I went out of my way to make these notes as understandable as possible for other wretched people that have not taken a single analysis exam in their whole life and now have to face integral equations.
