ok fuckers
time to learn how to use the almighty pacco
and how to work around the limitations of overleaf, because i will NOT TOLERATE not to use fancy colorboxes & i am a cheap fuck so I will not buy overleaf premium.

i'd recommend the following approach:
    - create a new tex file for each chapter/lecture
    - add the following pre/post-amble:

\documentclass[crop=false, class=article]{standalone}
\usepackage{pacco}
\begin{document}

\end{document}

      this will ensure that you only compile the lecture you're editing.
    - add /input{standalonefilename.tex} to the main document.

you can also use my custom environments:
    - theorem
    - definition
    - proposition
    - corollary
    - lemma
    - notation
    - fancyproof
    - revise
they are all numbered so... just use them without worries! they are tcolorboxes so the performance will be affected but honestly who cares. 

i also recommend looking into pacco.sty for some useful macros i have defined. i am sorry, that file is a mess and one day i'll clean it up. some useful macros are:
    - \ev for expected value
    - \indi for indicator function
    - \var and \cov for variance and covariance
    - \E, \F, \HS, \G are respectively calligraphic E, F, H and G
