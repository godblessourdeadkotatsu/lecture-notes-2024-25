	\section{Exercise 1}
	We start this discussion by taking a look at the main characteristics of the network of queues in question.\\
	In this system we have $N=10$ machines departing from the ``delay station'' $Z$
	In this case the distribution of all the three stations are \emph{negative exponential distributions}:
	\begin{equation*}
		F_X(x)=\pr(X\leq x)=1-e^{-\frac{1}{\eta} x}\qquad f_X(x)=\frac{\dif F_X}{\dx}=\lambda e^{-\frac{1}{\eta} x}.
	\end{equation*}
	In this formulation the parameter is given directly as the expected value $\ev[X]=\eta$ of the distribution. We have our three expected values, reflecting the main 
	This characteristic brings us to the particular case of the tandem server with ``M/M/2'' service and arrival times seen during lectures. 
In this problem, due to the memoryless property of the negative exponential distribution for all time variables (e.g., failure times, short and long repair times), defining regeneration points is straightforward. For example, a regeneration point can be set as the time when a machine enters the long repair station and the system resets to its initial conditions. This choice is based on the following schema:
		
		\begin{table}[h!]
			\centering
			\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
			\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{4cm}|m{4cm}|}
				\hline
				\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Service time distribution of the first queue}} &
				\multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{Service time distribution of the second queue}} \\ 
				\cline{2-3}
				& \textbf{GENERAL} & \textbf{MARKOV (Neg-Exp)} \\ 
				\hline
				\textbf{GENERAL} & Any departure that leaves behind exactly $N - 1$ customers from one of the two servers of the network & Any departure from the first server \\ 
				\hline
				\textbf{MARKOV (Neg-Exp)} & Any departure from the second server & Any departure in the system \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Service time distribution schema for the first and second queue.}
		\end{table}
	in which we can easily notice we are in the bottom-right case, in which the service times of both the queue are negative-exponential.
	
	\paragraph{Statistical Analysis}
	Using the regenerative method, we accumulate observations (e.g., waiting times) during each cycle. The point estimate for the expected value of a performance metric $r$ can be calculated as:
	\[
	\hat{r} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^p A_j}{\sum_{j=1}^p \nu_j}
	\]
	where $A_j$ is the accumulated performance measure during the $j$-th cycle, and $\nu_j$ is the length of that cycle. Confidence intervals are constructed using auxiliary variables that account for correlations within the data.
	
	\paragraph{Application to the Problem}
	The regenerative method simplifies simulation for the Machine Repairman system by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Breaking the simulation into cycles defined by identifiable regeneration points (e.g., arrival of a machine to the long repair station).
		\item Ensuring independence between cycles, thus enabling accurate estimation of steady-state metrics like average waiting time.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This approach ensures reliable results while adhering to the specified precision and confidence level.

	\section*{Simulation Results for 10 Customers}
	The simulation gives the following results:
	
	\noindent\textbf{Station 0 Results:}
	\begin{table}[h!]

			\toprule
			Throughput ($X[10]$)              & \textbf{0.002935} \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Station 1 Results:}
	\begin{table}[h!]

		\begin{tabular}{@{}l l@{}}

			Throughput ($X[10]$)              & \textbf{0.002935} \\

			Mean waiting time ($w[10]$)       & \textbf{44.708658} \\
			Mean response time ($R_0$)        & \textbf{84.708658} \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Station 2 Results:}
	\begin{table}[h!]

		\begin{tabular}{@{}l l@{}}
			\toprule
			Throughput ($X[10]$)              & \textbf{0.000587} \\
			Utilization ($U[10]$)             & \textbf{0.563560} \\
			Mean queue length ($n[10]$)       & \textbf{1.063150} \\
			Mean waiting time ($w[10]$)       & \textbf{1811.030708} \\
			Mean response time ($R_0$)        & \textbf{2771.030708} \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	
	we can notice easily that the mean waiting time for the long repair station is $1811.030$ which is compatible with our benchmark. 
	
	\section{Exercise 2}
	The second exercise focuses on analyzing the Machine Repairman system under a modified scenario where the repair time for machines directed to the long repair lab is modeled using a hyper-exponential distribution. This distribution introduces two exponential phases, reflecting high variability in repair durations, and is defined by the following parameters:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Phase 1:} Weight $\alpha_1 = 0.95$, Mean $\mu_1 = 10$ minutes.
		\item \textbf{Phase 2:} Weight $\alpha_2 = 0.05$, Mean $\mu_2 = 19010$ minutes.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This configuration captures the reality of repair processes, where most failures are resolved quickly, but a small fraction requires significantly longer times.
	
	The objective is to estimate the average waiting time at the long repair station using the regenerative simulation method. The analysis must achieve a confidence level of $95\%$ and ensure the width of the confidence interval is no greater than $10\%$ of the point estimate. Validation of the simulation model is incorporated by introducing a modification that enables the system to be solved analytically using the Mean Value Analysis algorithm. This allows for a comparison between simulated and analytical results, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the findings.
	
	In order to solve this exercise we have, firstly, to give a look to the table shown above, here we are in the bottom-left part, since the first queue is negative-exponential, while the second is not. Hence, we can choose again the departure from the long-repair station as a regenerating point.
