		This document stems from the fact that I just seem unable to pass the Probability Theory exam for the life of me. I regret with every ounce of my being the fact that I enrolled to the Stochastics and Data Science master degree a year ago. Since dear Professor Toaldo never really thrilled me with his insightful lectures about this delightful topic, I resorted to watch the old lectures by Professor Polito, who at least seems to know the subject and to be determined to explain it.\\
		Unlike many among my esteemed colleagues I have NOT a background in mathematics so there will be a lot of repetitions and possibly mistakes. Do what you want with this information. YES I KNOW that there are the whiteboard registrations of his lectures but if I DECIDED TO DO THIS it was because I couldn't comprehend shit with only those notes.\\
		I'll also try to compile the notes made by Professor Sacerdote, in the vain attempt to overcome the drowsiness that is congenitally entwined with every event that contemplates her uttering any words.\\
		I take much pride in my custom environment and in my packages. If you don't like them I will be very sad. \\
		It is strongly recommended to play Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 before reading these notes to fully understand the subject treated.

	That's it. I really hated this last part. What really makes me angry is that this shit could even be remotely interesting if it wasn't all a slop of notions and theorems. Professor Sacerdote really takes the joy out of everything.\par
	I'm sorry for the mistakes, there might be many. But still, this should be better than looking at the notes by Polito or Sacerdote. At least I hope so.
